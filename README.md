# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Complex Datasets

The process of preparing and cleaning datasets can often be a challenging task due to various factors such as dataset size, data recording errors, inconsistencies in data recording methods, and selecting inappropriate datasets.

`In this repository, I aim to delve into and manipulate intricate and complex datasets. I will be working with high-level big data frameworks and programming libraries such as **Polars**, **Dask**, **Kafka**, and more.`

This objective presents an exciting challenge, and the repository will be regularly updated as I continue to explore and learn new concepts and techniques in data analysis and manipulation.
